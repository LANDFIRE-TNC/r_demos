Task centric
1. Download
2. Clip and prep
3. Chart
4. Map
5. Compare
6. Other (e.g., connect to outside packages such as GEE)


This would be easier to deal with---i.e, would make sense to work with data on charts page you already downloaded in that page.  

OR is it product-centric? (no no no)

1. BpS download, clip, chart
2. EVT download, clip, map
3. EVC, chart, maybe map?
4. Fuels-map in a different way

This is more LANDFIRE forward and totally workable



Regardless need to do a good job highlighting/formatting so readers can find the code they want
