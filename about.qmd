Welcome to the LANDFIRE R Toolkit â€” your go-to hub for accelerating landscape analysis with LANDFIRE and R. Here, you'll find tested, ready-to-use R code that simplifies data access, processing, and visualization for your region. Whether you're a seasoned analyst or just getting started, this site helps you fast-track your workflow and connect with a growing community of LANDFIRE users who are actively coding, sharing, and tackling real-world challenges.
