## Why this site?

Do you work with LANDFIRE data and want a faster way to dig into ecological patterns across your landscape? You‚Äôre in the right place.

This site features quick R code snippets to help you get started (or go deeper) with LANDFIRE data. We recognize the power of well-written code and encourage the LANDFIRE community to build on this foundation of work. These R code examples are designed to be practical, repeatable, and flexible to fit your needs. We hope the coding tools provided can help you automate your work, leverage LANDFIRE, and get solution-oriented support.

We want to hear from you. Do you have feedback, ideas, or a cool way you‚Äôre using LANDFIRE data with R? -> [Send them our way](mailto:landfire@tnc.org){target="blank"}. Let‚Äôs build a community of practice together.

## üîç Overview

**Step 1:** LANDFIRE Data ‚Äì Choose the LANDFIRE Product for your analysis. 
Need help deciding? [Check the LANDFIRE Products here.](https://landfire-tnc.github.io/LANDFIRE_101/1_what-is-landfire.html){target="blank"}  

**Step 2:** R Code Demos ‚Äì Use the sample R code on this site to explore your area of interest.

**Step 3:** Adjust LANDFIRE to match local conditions.
Not sure how to do that? [Check out our tutorial.](https://conservationgateway.org/ConservationPractices/FireLandscapes/LANDFIRE/Documents/ModifyingLF_DataGuide_V1.pdf){target="blank"}   

**Step 4:** Insights & Innovations ‚Äì Build your own tools, share your work, connect with us.

## üîß Working Example

Using R and LANDFIRE products to explore trends and automate analyses can improve outcomes. Based on current LANDFIRE Products, the example code and visualizations will **all** be based on Map Zone 35, located in Central Texas.

Contained in Map Zone 35 are multiple ecosystems that provide a colorful sandbox to explore these coding demonstrations.

## Getting Started

1. Check your R, R-Studio and package versions. We recommend running the most current version of R or R-Studio.  Our R Session info is at the bottom of the  [About](about.qmd) page. 
2. Check file paths - is your your R-Studio project correctly set up?
3. Let us know if you run into code bugs [landfire@tnc.org](mailto:landfire@tnc.org){target="blank"}
