title: "LANDFIRE R Demos"
author: "Randy Swaty and Megan Dettenmaier"

We are excited to share some R code bits that will help you in your use of LANDFIRE data to assess and visualize ecological patterns on your landscape.  We share these bits of code in hopes of not only helping you accelerate your use of LANDFIRE data, but also as a way to start a conversation.  We'd love to hear your suggestions, and stories of LANDFIRE data processing with R!

## Disclaimers and how to get help

Here we are sharing code that we use often.  It works for us and has been tested.  That said, we are not programmers and have not dealt with every possible user environment (e.g., R-Studio, R and/or package versions), do not intend for this to be a general R coding tutorial and cannot take responsibility for outcomes of you trying this code.

All of that said, we do want you to be successful and ask that you follow these steps if you run into issues:

1. Check your R, R-Studio and package versions.  Are they relatively up to date?
2. Ensure that you have set up your R-Studio project correctly so that file paths work as expected.
3. As possible troubleshoot with Google and/or your favorite AI
4. If all else fails e-mail [landfire@tnc.org](mailto:landfire@tnc.org)

## Example outputs

Over time we will be adding to the list of demos and outputs you will create.

### Biophysical Settings

In this demonstration we:

1.  Download LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings (BpS) data, manage and load into R
2.  Crop, mask and build attribute table for the area
3.  Make a simple bar chart of the top BpSs using ggplot2
4.  Make an interactive hexbin map as one way to tackle some of the challenges of mapping categorical raster data.

**One example output:**

## Area of Interest for these demonstrations

For the demonstrations we used LANDFIRE Map Zone 35 that is located in central Texas.  This area contains multiple ecosystems, and was fun for us to work with.
