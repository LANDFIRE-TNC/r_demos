## Why this site?

Do you work with LANDFIRE data and want a faster way to dig into ecological patterns across your landscape? You‚Äôre in the right place.

This site features quick R code demonstrations to help you get started (or go deeper) with LANDFIRE data. We recognize the power of well-written code and encourage the LANDFIRE community to build on this foundation of work. These r code examples are designed to be practical, repeatable, and flexible to fit your needs. We hope the coding tools provided can help you automate your work, leverage LANDFIRE, and get solution-oriented support.

We want to hear from you. Do you have feedback, ideas, or a cool way you‚Äôre using LANDFIRE data with R? [Send them our way](landfire@tnc.org). 

Let‚Äôs build a community of practice together.

## Why does this matter?

LANDFIRE's Product Suite is vast and updated regularly. With a rapid annual update schedule, it can be challenging to ensure you're working with the most current version. Automating this step with LANDFIRE's API toolbox using the R demo code provided on this site can ensure you are using the latest products without any extra work.

## Connecting Code & LANDFIRE: Example

Using R and LANDFIRE products to explore trends and automate analyses can improve outcomes. Based on current LANDFIRE Products, the example code and visualizations will be based on [Map Zone 35, located in Central Texas](assets/mz35.jpg){fig-alt="A map of LANDFIRE Map Zone 35, which is a large circular area in central Texas."}. Contained in this map zone are multiple ecosystems that provided a colorful sandbox to explore these coding demonstrations.

## Getting Started

1. Check your R, R-Studio and package versions. We recommend running the most current version of R or R-Studio.
2. Check file paths - is your your R-Studio project correctly set up?
3. Let us know if you run into code bugs [landfire@tnc.org](mailto:landfire@tnc.org)
