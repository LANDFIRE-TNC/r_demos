We are excited to share some R code bits that we think will help you in your use of LANDFIRE data to assess and visualize ecological patterns on your landscape.  We share these bits of code in hopes of not only helping you accelerate your use of LANDFIRE data, but also as a way to start a conversation.  We'd love to hear your suggestions, and stories of LANDFIRE data processing with R!

## Example outputs

Over time we will be adding to the list of demos and outputs you will create.

### Biophysical Settings

In this demonstration we:

1.  Download LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings (BpS) data, manage and load into R
2.  Crop, mask and build attribute table for the area
3.  Make a simple bar chart of the top BpSs using ggplot2
4.  Make an interactive hexbin map as one way to tackle some of the challenges of mapping categorical raster data.

## Area of Interest for these demonstrations

For the demonstrations we used LANDFIRE Map Zone 35 that is located in central Texas.  This area contains multiple ecosystems, and was fun for us to work with.
