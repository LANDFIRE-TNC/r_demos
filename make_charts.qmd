title: "Make simple charts with LANDFIRE data"
---



## Skills learned

Summarizing data in charts is a quick way to convey patterns and, in the case below, demonstrate which LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings were mapped as most dominant on our landscape


## Set up

To run the code below you will need to:

1. Work through the preceding pages, [Download data](docs/download.html) and [Prepare rasters](docs/prep_rasters.html), or otherwise make sure you have a datasheet with BpS names and Relative Percentages at the least. 
2. 


### Code to load packages and inputs

```{r}
#| label: Load packages and data
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| code-overflow: wrap
#| include: true
#| results: hide

library(tidyverse)








```
